# TypeScript Type System Limitations: Runtime Errors Despite Static Typing

This repository demonstrates a scenario where TypeScript's type system, while robust, doesn't prevent all runtime errors.  Despite static typing, a function's inconsistent usage can lead to unexpected behavior at runtime.

The `bug.ts` file contains code that shows the issue.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a possible solution through enhanced input validation.
